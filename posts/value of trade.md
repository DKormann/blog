can contract be stable between human (now) and AI (later)

the economic insight that trade can be beneficial to all partners even if one is better at everything is hugely positive

reading [crystal society](https://crystalbooks.ai/) at the moment.
different AIs share a body trading with each other energy to accomplish different goals. Establishing trading relationships often removes need for direct conflict. Just settle by paying. This only works as long as contracts are enforced.

in rational multiplayer scenarios contracts can be enforced through reputation. I wonder how strong this can be.
